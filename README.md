## Compiling
### You need:

* SFML 2.5+ 32 bit development headers and library [(Download)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
* C++11 compliant compiler (Visual C++ compiler recommended)
* CMake build system

### Compiling is straight forward with cmake but if you want to make a project in Visual Studio (2019 recommended):

1. Code -> Open with Visual Studio (or Download ZIP file)
2. Unpack the library files and put them in the same directory with the project sources
3. Add these files to your project in Visual Studio (if you downloaded ZIP)
4. Configure your project [using this guide.](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)
